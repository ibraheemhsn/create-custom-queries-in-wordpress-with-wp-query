# [Create Custom Queries in WordPress With WP_Query][published url]
## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]


On every page that your site displays, WordPress runs a queryâ€”whether to retrieve a static page or to generate an archive list. Usually the default query is enough, but sometimes you want to go a little further. That's where `WP_Query` comes in. WP_Query is a powerful tool you can use to customise the way your WordPress site queries the database. 

In this course you'll learn how to harness the power of the `WP_Query` class to write your own custom queries. You'll learn how to get a theme and plugin working together with a custom query, how to change the query parameters, and how `WP_Query` works together with the Loop. Along the way, you'll get to code a number of practical examples that show how useful `WP_Query` can be.
